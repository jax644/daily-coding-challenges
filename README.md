## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is organized by platform and difficulty level:

📁 Codewars/ 📁 8kyu/ 📁 7kyu/ 📁 6kyu/ 📁 5kyu/ 
📁LeetCode/ 📁 Easy/ 📁 Medium/ 📁 Hard/

Each folder contains:
- Solution files (`.js` or language-specific extensions)
- Problem descriptions as comments in the solution files
- Additional notes or edge cases (if applicable)

## 🤔 Why This Repo?
- To document my growth as a developer ✨
- To share insights on coding challenges with others 👩‍💻👨‍💻
- To prepare for technical interviews 🚀

## 📜 Code of Conduct
- Both Codewars and LeetCode have clear guidelines against copying solutions. Feel free to check out my solutions, but please do not copy them.  For the best experience, try solving them on your own first, then compare your solution to mine if you'd like!

**Happy coding!✨**
